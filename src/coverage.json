        "summary": "Make the dataset upload flow resilient to backend failures by preventing a failed `addCleaningLog` call from crashing the entire upload operation, and by surfacing a clear, actionable error when the backend canister is stopped (IC0508). Update both single upload (`useUploadDocument`) and batch upload (`useUploadDocumentsBatch`) to (a) wrap `actor.addCleaningLog(...)` in try/catch, (b) if logging fails, continue with `uploadDocument` when possible, and (c) if the failure is an IC replica/canister-stopped rejection (e.g., reject_message includes \"is stopped\" / error_code IC0508), throw an Error with an English message that explicitly states the backend canister is stopped and the upload cannot proceed until it is started/redeployed.",
