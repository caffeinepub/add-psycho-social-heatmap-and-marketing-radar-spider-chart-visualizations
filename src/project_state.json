  "summary": "Build dashboard visualizations (Psycho-Social Heatmap and Radar charts—including Marketing Effectiveness and Marketing Mix) and generate a more comprehensive Strategic Recommendation Report that analyzes outputs from each visualization, with an in-app PDF download button for decision-makers, plus apply a modern-minimal UI refresh across the entire app using a white/blue palette and attractive icons for main menu items.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Psycho-Social Heatmap dimensions should be based on UTAUT2: PE (Performance Expectancy/Harapan Kinerja), EE (Effort Expectancy/Harapan Usaha), SI (Social Influence/Pengaruh Sosial), HM (Hedonic Motivation/Motivasi Hedonis), FC (Facilitating Conditions/Kondisi Pendukung), PV (Price Value/Nilai Harga), H (Habit/Kebiasaan).",
    "Add a Marketing Mix radar chart with the following axes/labels and short codes: Product—Innovative Product Strategy (PROD); Price—Innovative Pricing Architecture (PRICE); Place—Innovative Distribution Network (DIST); Promotion—Innovative Communication Strategy (COMM); People—Innovative Human Resource Development (HRD); Process—Innovative Customer Journey Design (CUSJ); Physical Evidence—Innovative Brand Experience Creation (BRAND); Collaboration Ecosystem Strategy (proposed).",
    "Upload pipeline should support schema mapping/normalization from incoming dataset headers (ID, Date, Region, Source, User, text, Aspect_Category, Keywords_Extracted) into the app’s internal document model used for downstream analysis/visualizations.",
    "Strategic Recommendation Report should include a dedicated section that synthesizes insights from each dashboard visualization (emotion distribution, UTAUT2 heatmap, marketing mix radar, purchase intention where available) into actionable recommendations, and support generating a PDF for download.",
    "Dashboard marketing/intro copy should support localization (English/Bahasa Indonesia), at minimum for the \"Understand Customer Emotions\" heading and description.",
    "Dashboard hero headline should display \"Pahami Emosi Pelanggan\" with blue text styling (ensure consistent with existing layout/styling constraints).",
    "Purchase Intention analysis/report section depends on purchase-intention inputs; when missing, the report shows a note that Purchase Intention data is unavailable. User requested auto-adding/generating fields like intention_level and intention_score for uploaded CSVs.",
    "UI refresh direction: modern minimal style across the entire application; use white/blue as the primary palette.",
    "Icons: add icons only for main menu items (not every menu entry); icon library/style is flexible as long as it fits modern-minimal and looks attractive.",
    "Header styling requirement: set the entire header/navigation background to a blue gradient (full-width background), not just active item/accents."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Ensure all dashboard visualizations (charts/heatmap/radar/report) reliably render when valid input data is provided; potential rendering/state update issue after data input.",
    "Emotion Distribution chart still displays even when the app is not currently analyzing data; should reflect correct analysis/loading/idle state (likely stale analysis state or dataset detection).",
    "File upload can fail due to strict/incorrect dataset schema validation; current expected columns may not match real user datasets (e.g., ID, Date, Region, Source, User, text, Aspect_Category, Keywords_Extracted).",
    "Dataset upload can fail with IC0508 (reject_code 5) because backend canister 33tw5-ziaaa-aaaai-q5roq-cai is stopped; observed during addCleaningLog call."
